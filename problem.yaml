        Can you help me?
        Recently, I found an executable binary.
        As I'm a true newbie,
        Certainly, to solve it, I will have difficulties.
        Keep in mind, the first step is quite easy.
        Maybe the last one will be quite tricky.
        Emulating it could be a good idea.
